Ok, here's the deal. I'm writing a little rust CLI app for linux and mac that is meant to function in a piped linux command model. it takes piped input (newline seperated), pauses for user selection from a list made up of the piped input, then prints the selection for further piped cli commands/tools. I've never written Rust before. Please use the dialoguer library/crate. the input text will look something like `cat file.txt | pick | ssh` with the file looking something like `Option 1\nOption 2` or `Option 1\nOption 2\n`. The user will make a selection and the selection will be passed to the next piece of the pipe chain. Please be thorough, this is my first rust project.
